# trackIT

This project is the latest version of the trtackIT app, my final project from tghe Lighthouse Web Development Bootcamp in Dec 2021. 

A project management utility intended for internal use within an organization. Users can create projects and assign/manage team members as well as create and track tickets and issues on the specific project they are working on.

This project is built with react in the front-end and ruby on rails in the back-end. PostgreSQL is used as database to persist all data. Among other tech stacks used are material ui, storybook, reactstrap, react-router, chartjs-2, react-slack-chat.


For now, the project uses firebase for all backend services, but will later be migrated to use a full PERN stack (Postgres, Express, React and Node JS)


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
